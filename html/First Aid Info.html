                            Start chest compressions by pushing hard and fast in the center of the chest (at least 2 inches deep) at a rate of 100-120 compressions per minute.

                            If you're trained, combine chest compressions with rescue breaths (30 compressions followed by 2 breaths) until help arrives.
